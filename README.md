U of R Data Bootcamp SciPy and MatPlotLib assignment

For this assignemnt, I really felt like it was the first time I was using a lot more online research to get the answers faster. I definitely found myself refering back to the pandas source material & guides online (listed below). 

Usually I'd just keep trying different options in assignments, but this time I decided to actually read a lot more of the material to understand what options I had with different variables and syntax. 

I really have found that I'm liking using this more than I do trying to get a clear answer out of stack overflow since the source material makes it easier (at least in my mind) to put together the functions & make sure they run properly.
